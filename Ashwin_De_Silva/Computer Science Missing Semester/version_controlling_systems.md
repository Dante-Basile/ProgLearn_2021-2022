# Version Controlling Systems

## Introduction 
 
* VCS keeps track of the changes made to the source code. This is done through a series of snapshots.

* VCS facilitates collaborations. (sending code to others, resolving issues, etc.) 
 
* Why is version control useful? Even when youâ€™re working by yourself, it can let you look at old snapshots of a project, keep a log of why certain changes were made, work on parallel branches of development, and much more.  
 
* Modern VCSs also let you easily (and often automatically) answer questions like: 
    * Who wrote this module? 
    * When was this particular line of this particular file edited? By whom? Why was it edited? 
    * Over the last 1000 revisions, when/why did a particular unit test stop working?
