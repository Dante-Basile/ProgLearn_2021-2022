### Introduction: The Abstract Forest Model
Unified model of decision forests - classification, regression, density estimation, manifold learning, semi-supervised learning, and active learning

Prototypical machine learning problems --> general model   (different parameterizations)

Pro: only need to implement once and make small modifications in applications
