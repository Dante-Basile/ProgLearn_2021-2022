# Week 1 Notes - 9/6
## Figure Checklist
- main point should stand out
- remove unnecessary markings
- consistent color
- title has context
- legible text
- caption should be a sentence, defines acronyms, points out interesting part of figure
- consistent lines/markers
- aesthetics
- remove redundancies 
- check if table can be a figure

## How to Choose a Project
- Feasibility
  - Does one have the necessary background?
  - Does one have the time/resources?
- Significance
  - How many people were impacted?
  - How much was each person impacted?
- Motivation
  - What kinds of things does one do in one's free time?

## Omnidirectional Transfer for Quasilinear Lifelong Learning
- classical ML - starts from tabula rasa
- continual learning - improve/maintain performance on all tasks
- Intro
  - catastrophic forgetting - sequential training causes forgetting learning of prior tasks
  - past approaches to catastrophic forgetting: reallocate resources to learn new knowledge (akin to human adulthood), add new data as it comes in (akin to development in humans)
  - proposed approach: omnidirectional learning
  - ProgNN - transfer only forwards, not backwards
  - 2 algorithms: a) decision forests, b) deep networks
-
